# Masters-Research-Project

This repository contains my Gradute Reserch Project code. Following methods were implemented for my project:
1) Created C++ based solver for simulation of high speed interconnects.
2) Apply Linear Model Order Reduction on stochastic models.
3) Used MPI and OpenMP on CRAY supercomputer to improve performance by a factor of 30.
4) Implemented simulator in C++ for stamping circuit elements using nodal formulation and modified nodal analysis.
5) Solved linear network equations using LAPACK routine and differential network equations using trapezoidal rule.
